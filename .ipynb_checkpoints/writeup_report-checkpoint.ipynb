    "Here the [rubric points](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/432/view) are considered individually and described how each point is addressed in the implementation.  \n",

    "### Files Submitted & Code Quality\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Submission includes all required files and can be used to run the simulator in autonomous mode\n",
    "\n",
    "My project includes the following files:\n",
    "* Model.py containing the script to create and train the model\n",
    "* drive.py for driving the car in autonomous mode\n",
    "* model.h5 containing a trained convolution neural network \n",
    "* writeup_report summarizing the results\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Submission includes functional code\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the Udacity provided simulator and the drive.py file, the car can be driven autonomously around the track by executing the following command.\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "python drive.py model.h5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Submission code is usable and readable\n",
    "\n",
    "The Model.py file contains the code for training and saving the convolution neural network. The file shows the pipeline I used for training and validating the model, and it contains comments to explain how the code works.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code contains mainly three sections, the first section of the code reads log file from the simulator and stores the file names of the images and the steering angle data in a pandas dataframe. The second section of the code contains the generator function, whhich reads the images and the steering values and feeds the network with input values and the reference values. The third section of the code contains the neural network implemented in keras which trained using the data from the generator and finally the network is stored as model.h5 file.\n",

    "#### Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "The images captured by the simulator are given the to the network. The input images are coloured images of size 160 x 320 pixel size. The image is preprocessed in three steps before being feed to the network. The image captured from the simulator is a three channel colour image of format BGR. But the drive.py which is used to run the simulator in autonomous mode feeds the network with image of RGB format. So as a firt step the image is converted from BGR to RGB format. Then the input images are 8 bit images with values of pixels between 0 and 255. So the image is normalized to have zero mean and equal variance in the horizontal and vertical direction. The normalization is done using the following formula.\n",

    "$X'=a+{\\frac {\\left(X-X_{\\min }\\right)\\left(b-a\\right)}{X_{\\max }-X_{\\min }}}$\n",

    "$ X_{\\max }= 255 $\n",
    "\n",
    "$a =  -0.5$\n",
    "\n",
    "$b = 0.5$\n",
    "\n",
    "The input image not only contains the picture of the road but also the road enviroment such as trees, mountains, parts of car etc. But for calculating the steering angle does not need this information so these unwanted section of the images are cropped before it is feed to the neural network. \n",
